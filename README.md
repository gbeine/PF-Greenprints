# Greenprints for Pathfinder Classes Wizard

This repository contains character definitions collected from different sources, e.g. the CallOfTheWild mod for Pathfinder Kingmaker.

The files are intended to use together with the [Pathfinder ClassesWizard](https://github.com/gbeine/PF-ClassesWizard).

Just copy the Greenprints directory into the mod's installation directory to use the described classes.

Of course, you can contribute your own classes, just fork the repo and send in a PR.

Documentation can be found together with the  [Pathfinder ClassesWizard](https://github.com/gbeine/PF-ClassesWizard).

Have fun with it, but be aware that I will not provide any support for this.
